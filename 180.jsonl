The expression \"Tumor cell cluster in alveolar space, strand-like formation\" suggests a group of cells that are clustered together and have a strand-like appearance. In the image, there are areas that show a cluster of cells with a somewhat cohesive structure, which could be indicative of a tumor cell cluster. The strand-like formation is more evident in the upper left portion of the image, where there is a group of cells that appear to be connected in a linear fashion.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the bounding box should encompass the area where the tumor cell cluster and the strand-like formation are most prominent.
