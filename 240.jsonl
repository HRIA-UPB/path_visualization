The small cluster of detached tumor cells in the alveolar space is a key feature to identify. The alveolar space is typically seen as a network of small, air-filled spaces within the lung tissue. The tumor cells are often characterized by abnormal, irregularly shaped nuclei and cytoplasm.\n\nIn this image, there is a distinct cluster of cells with dark, irregular nuclei located in the center of the image. These cells are not in a normal tissue arrangement and appear to be detached, which is consistent with the description of tumor cells in the alveolar space. The bounding box should encompass this cluster.\n\nThe bounding box should be drawn around the area where the small cluster of detached tumor cells is located. The cells are centrally located in the image, and the bounding box should be drawn to include this area.\n\n</think>\n\\boxed{[695, 995, 985, 1227]}", "gts": "[1552, 308, 1775, 545]", "score": 0.1, "step": 240, "reward": 0.10000000149011612, "format_reward": 1.0, "acc_reward": 0.0, "image_path": "refpath_image/9144.jpg"}

The presence of tumor cells and the alveolar space are indicative of a tissue sample from a lung biopsy or similar procedure.\n\nThe expression \"Tumor cell cluster in alveolar space, strand-like formation\" suggests a specific pattern of cell arrangement within the alveolar space. The alveolar space is the small air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. The term \"strand-like formation\" implies a linear or elongated arrangement of cells.\n\nIn the provided image, there are areas that appear to show a cluster of cells with a linear arrangement, which could be indicative of a tumor cell cluster in the alveolar space. The cells are stained in a way that highlights the nuclei, which are darker, and the cytoplasm, which is lighter. The presence of a strand-like formation is more evident in the central part of the image, where there is a clear linear arrangement of cells.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the bounding box should encompass the area where the tumor cell cluster in the alveolar space is most clearly visible, with a focus on the strand-like formation.\n\n</think>\n\\boxed{[233, 602, 602, 826]}", "gts": "[239, 535, 936, 934]", "score": 0.36187720748478247, "step": 240, "reward": 0.3618772029876709, "format_reward": 1.0, "acc_reward": 0.2909746749830916, "image_path": "refpath_image/22820.jpg"}
