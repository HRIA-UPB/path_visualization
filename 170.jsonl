This area seems to be the most consistent with the description given.\n\n</think>\n\\boxed{[0, 1060, 308, 1328]}", "gts": "[0, 1097, 305, 1327]", "score": 0.8648647993797248, "step": 170, "reward": 0.8648648262023926, "format_reward": 1.0, "acc_reward": 0.8498497770885831, "image_path": "refpath_image/25222.jpg"}
